# Virtual-Park: Driver App
This directory is a full-stack web application for Virtual-Parking, a parking permit app inspired by the difficulty of acquiring permits for the UCSC campus. It is being developed with a mobile-first mindset, with the colors being based on UCSC's official colors.

This specific directory is for users who are drivers that wish to purchase parking permits. Other user types such as parking enforcment who would issue tickets will have their own app elsewhere.

## Planned Features
* Vehicle Registration
* Virtual Permits: Purchases, Purchase History, Expiration Notifications, and more!
* Parking Tickets: View, Pay, and Appeal parking tickets!
* [TBD]
