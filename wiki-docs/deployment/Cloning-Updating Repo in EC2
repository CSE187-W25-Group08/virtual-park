# To Clone Repo Into EC2 (I already did the initial clone, but keep steps here in case we need to clone again)

```
git clone [URL]
```

CLONING WILL REQUIRE GITHUB USERNAME AND PASSWORD
username is your username
password is a personal access token (PAT)

HOW TO GET PAT
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "EC2 Access Token"
4. Expiration: 30 days (or whatever you want)
5. Select scopes: repo (full control of private repositories)
6. Click Generate token
7. GitHub will give you a long string (your token).
8. Paste this long string in the password field


```
cd project-repo-name
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

```
nohup npm start &
```


# To Update App After Pushing New Changes

1. Go to app folder

(this step may need username and password again. How to get password token is shown above)
2. ```git pull```

3. ```npm run build```

4. Kill the old running app
  ```ps aux | grep node```

  Find the process ID (PID) of your npm start, then:
  ```kill PID```

  Restart the app:
  ```nohup npm start &```
